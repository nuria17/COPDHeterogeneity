# COPDHeterogeneity

This repository contains the scripts used to perform the analysis described in the master thesis "New insights into molecular heterogeneity of COPD", supervised by Rosa Faner, Rosalba Lepora and Jon Sanchez from IDIBAPS and Barcelona Supercomputing Center. The omics and clinical data that were used in this study are not currently available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository since the article has not been published in a peer-review journal yet.
